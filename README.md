# sqlalchemy-challenge

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.

Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.


Use the provided starter notebook and hawaii.sqlite files to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.


Use SQLAlchemy create_engine to connect to your sqlite database.


Use SQLAlchemy automap_base() to reflect your tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called Station and Measurement.


Link Python to the database by creating an SQLAlchemy session.
